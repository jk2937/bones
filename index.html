                <h1>Welcome</h1>

                <p>Welcome to Bones, a 2D game engine for the web, currently in development!</p>

                <h1>Introduction</h1>

                <p>Regardless of the type of game you may want to build, they all share the same 'bones.' Specifically, every game requires graphics and sound, support for user input, and rendering of menus and animations. Many require network capabilities for online multiplayer and social media integration. With Bones, these functions will be implemented as simply and extensibly as possible, serving as the foundation for apps and games.</p>

                <h1>Web first</h1>

                <p>Bones is written in Javascript, making it best for web games and apps. A game made using Bones does not require any installation or setup from the end user. One click and the user is playing your game. Updates also happen seamlessly, with no interaction required from the user. This makes it ideal for online games, where users can connect with their friends and play together without needing any setup.</p> 

                <h1>Open-source</h1>

                <p>Bones is, and always will be, entirely free and open-source, devoid of any advertisements. Feel free to use, alter, disseminate, and even monetize its codebase according to your needs. However, I request that you include the original Bones source code alongside your own projects when distributing them. There is no obligation to open-source your entire project; please consult the accompanying terms and conditions for further information.</p>
