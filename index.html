            <div class="paragraphs">
                <p>Welcome to Bones, a 2D game engine for the web written in JavaScript, currently in development!</p>

                <p>Regardless of the type of app I build, they will all share the same 'bones.' Specifically, every app will require graphical and auditory components, support for touch, mouse, and keyboard inputs, rendering of menus and animations, and basic network capabilities for online multiplayer or social media integration. With Bones, these functions will be implemented as simply and extensibly as possible, serving as the foundation for all my future apps and games.</p>

                <p>Bones is, and always will be, entirely free and open-source, devoid of any advertisements. Feel free to use, alter, disseminate, and even monetize its codebase according to your needs. However, I request that you include the original Bones source code alongside your own projects when distributing them. There is no obligation to open-source your entire project; please consult the accompanying terms and conditions for further information.</p>
